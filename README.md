# Reversi
A reverse game written by C in my vg101 class (Intro to computer and programming).

Just compile and run it, it will tell you how to use it before the game.

About the rule of reversi, you can refer to wikipedia for help.

It is just a simple game.

In particular, you can read the comment and try to use AI2.

Actually, it is easy to make a Player vs. AI and AI1 vd. AI2 mode.

Problems can be fixed: (I do not know if I have time to fix it)

  a. The AI may be a bit stupid although AI1 is better than AI2. I cannot decide that the position or the chess AI can eat is more important.
  
  b. No GUI (However, I do not want a gui here).
  
  c. The line of code is too long.
  
However, I enjoy it and hope you can enjoy it.
