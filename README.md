## Reversi
- A reverse game written by C in my vg101 class (Intro to computer and programming).
- Just compile and run it, it will tell you how to use it before the game.
- About the rule of reversi, you can refer to wikipedia for help.
- In particular, you can read the comment and try to use AI2.
- Actually, it is easy to make a Player vs. AI and AI1 vs. AI2 mode.

##### Problems can be fixed: (I do not know if I have time to fix it)
- The AI may be a bit stupid although AI1 is better than AI2. I cannot decide that the position or the chess AI can eat is more important.
- No GUI (However, I do not want a gui here).
- The line of code is too long.
  
##### However, I enjoy it and hope you can enjoy it.
